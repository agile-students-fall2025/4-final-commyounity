# Contributing Guide

Welcome to our project!  
This document explains how our team works together and how others can contribute effectively. It reflects our team values, collaboration norms, and coding practices — serving as a guide for all contributors.

We believe in open communication, accountability, and proactive teamwork, so please review this document before getting started.



## Team Norms

Our team follows these norms to stay connected and productive:

- **Communication tools:** We use **Discord** and **Zoom** for real-time collaboration.  
  For issue tracking and task management, we rely on **GitHub Issues**.
- **Proactivity:** Team members are encouraged to take initiative, share ideas, and help others without being asked.
- **Respect and reliability:** Be prepared, communicate clearly, and respect everyone’s time and input.

Our goal is to maintain a transparent, efficient, and collaborative workflow.



## Team Values

Our team culture is built on mutual respect, openness, and accountability.

- **Open communication:** If anyone is struggling or falling behind, communicate it early — we support each other.  
- **Seeking help:** Use Discord to reach out to teammates for help or feedback.
- **Punctuality:** Be on time for meetings. If you’re running late or can’t attend, notify the team beforehand.
- **Conflict resolution:**  
  - First, try to find a **middle ground** that everyone can agree on.  
  - If consensus isn’t possible, we follow the **majority decision**.  
  - Everyone should have the opportunity to express their perspective.

We value honesty, transparency, and collaboration above hierarchy or ego.



## Sprint Cadence

We use a **two-week sprint cycle** to organize our work.

- Each sprint lasts **2 weeks**, but we aim to finish all assigned work **one day early** for review and adjustments.
- Shorter sprints create pressure, while longer ones reduce focus. Two weeks strikes a healthy balance.



## Daily Standups

Our standups ensure alignment and continuous progress.

- Held **three times a week** for approximately **15–25 minutes**.  
- Scheduled through **Google Calendar**.
- All members are expected to attend, unless there is an emergency.  
- If you cannot attend, inform the team and management as soon as possible.
- Missing **three consecutive standups** without notice will result in escalation to management.

These meetings keep communication open and help us address blockers quickly.



## Coding Standards

We maintain consistent, high-quality code through the following practices:

- **Editor:** All contributors use **VS Code** for this project.  
- **Naming:** Use **meaningful, descriptive names** for variables and functions. Avoid abbreviations.  
- **Comments:** Add concise and useful comments where necessary.  
- **Testing:** Test your code locally before submitting.  
- **Peer Review:** Every pull request must be **peer-reviewed and approved** before merging.  
- **Stable Code:** Always push **working code**. If your commit breaks the build, fix it immediately.  
- **Commits:**  
  - Make **small, focused commits** per feature or bug fix.  
  - Use **clear, descriptive commit messages**.  
- **Code Hygiene:** Remove commented-out or dead code. If you find any, delete it.  
- **Automated Testing:** Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (as we gain more experience with testing tools).

Our goal is clean, maintainable, and self-documenting code that others can easily understand and extend.



## Development Setup

*(To be updated as the project evolves.)*

This section will include instructions for:

- Setting up the local development environment  
- Installing dependencies  
- Building and testing the project  
- Running the project locally for development



## Git Workflow

We follow a straightforward Git workflow to keep our development organized:

1. **Fork** the repository and **clone** your copy.  
2. Create a new **branch** for your work using the format:  
   - `feature/your-feature-name` for new features  
   - `bugfix/your-bug-description` for bug fixes  
   - `docs/your-doc-name` for documentation updates  
3. Make your changes and **test** thoroughly before committing.  
4. Write **clear, single-line commit messages** describing what was changed.  
5. Push your branch to GitHub and open a **Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch.  
6. Wait for a **peer review**. At least one teammate must approve your PR before merging.  
7. Once approved, **merge** your PR using the "Squash and merge" option for a clean commit history.



## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository and **clone** your copy.  
2. Create a new **feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature-name`).  
3. Make your changes and **test** them thoroughly.  
4. Submit a **pull request (PR)** describing what you changed and why.  
5. Wait for a **peer review** and approval before merging.  
6. Once approved, your changes can be merged into the main branch.



## Final Thoughts

This document is meant to be **practical and realistic** — a reflection of how our team actually works.  
We avoid including rules we don’t follow or don’t believe in.  
As our team and project evolve, this guide will grow with us.

Together, we aim to build software that is reliable, well-documented, and enjoyable to maintain.
